# Pre-work - *ToDo App*

**ToDo App** is an android app that allows building a todo list and basic todo items management functionality including adding new items, editing and deleting an existing item.

Submitted by: **Marco Rizzi aka Sgt.MZ**

Time spent: **6-8** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [X] User can **successfully add and remove items** from the todo list
* [X] User can **tap a todo item in the list and bring up an edit screen for the todo item** and then have any changes to the text reflected in the todo list.
* [X] User can **persist todo items** and retrieve them properly on app restart

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Persist the todo items [into SQLite](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Persisting-Data-to-the-Device#sqlite) instead of a text file
* [ ] Improve style of the todo items in the list [using a custom adapter](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-an-ArrayAdapter-with-ListView)
* [ ] Add support for completion due dates for todo items (and display within listview item)
* [ ] Use a [DialogFragment](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-DialogFragment) instead of new Activity for editing items
* [ ] Add support for selecting the priority of each todo item (and display in listview item)
* [ ] Tweak the style improving the UI / UX, play with colors, images or backgrounds

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## Project Analysis

As part of your pre-work submission, please reflect on the app and answer the following questions below:

**Question 1:** "What are your reactions to the Android app development platform so far? Compare and contrast Android's approach to layouts and user interfaces in past platforms you've used."

**Answer:** Object names are obviously different, apart of that it doesn't seems particularly difficult, it will take some time to get used to, but the dev environment seems very well done. 

**Question 2:** "Take a moment to reflect on the `ArrayAdapter` used in your pre-work. How would you describe an adapter in this context and what is its function in Android? Why do you think the adapter is important? Explain the purpose of the `convertView` in the `getView` method of the `ArrayAdapter`."

**Answer:** I think it's an object container that can be used to store different things for different purposes, it can offer different ways of presenting the data using the 'convertView' method. Views are returned with the 'getView' method

## Notes

Challenges:
* a lot of properties to set the UI layout, had a lot of problems aligning objects
* in general, it's a little bit difficult to keep the code organized to avoid the "OnCreate" method to become too chaotic
* didn't found too much time to add any optional feature (sorry!)
